    <h1>CONVOLUTION</h1>
    <div class=blog_text_container>

      <p class='big'>
        A first step to deeply understand
        <a href = "html/convnet.html" target = "_self"> Convolutional Neural Networks </a>
        is to unterstand what these networks have to do with <i> Convolutions </i>.
				Actually, what is a convolution in the first place?
				To answer this question, lets consider two distinct signals. Lets call them \( f(t) \) and \( g(t) \).
				Since we are talking about signals, the most natural way to represent these functions,
				is by dependence of the time \( t \).

      <p class='big'>
				It is crusial that both signals are depending on the same variable to performe convolution.
				\( f,g: [0, \infty) \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \)

				$$ (f * g)(t) \triangleq \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} f(\tau) g(t - \tau) d \tau, $$

				Note that there are different mathematical notations describing the same process, like
				\( (f * g)(t) = f(t) * g(t) = f(t) \otimes g(t) \).
				For the sake of readabiliy and to avoid missunderstandings, espacially mix-ups with the multiplication sign,
				I will use the latter notation, \( f(t) \otimes g(t) \), in the ensuing scope of this blog.

				If you are working with convolutions, it is significant to know that they follow commutativity, thus

				$$ f(t) \otimes g(t) = g(t) \otimes f(t) $$

				To proof that, we can simply substitute \( t - \tau = \tau^\prime \), such that

				$$ f(t) \otimes g(t) = - \int_{+\infty}^{-\infty} f(t - \tau^\prime) g(\tau^\prime) d \tau^\prime. $$

				In other words, we are replacing \( \tau \) with \( t - \tau^\prime \), \( t - \tau \) with \( \tau^\prime \),
				and if there would be a single \( t \) it would get replaced by \( \tau^\prime - \tau \), just to complete
				the picture.
				Further, \( d \tau \) got replaced by \( - d \tau^\prime \), since

				$$ \frac{d\tau^\prime}{d\tau} = \frac{d(t - \tau)}{d\tau} \rightarrow d \tau^\prime = - d \tau. $$

				The attentive reader probably also recognized that the limits of the integral have changed, which is due to
				the reverved sign of the integration. However, since the limits are infinte, the origin shift introduced by the
				substitution by vector \( t \) does not alter the magnitude of the limits.
				Hence, we can reverse the order of the limits:

				$$ f(t) \otimes g(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} f(t - \tau^\prime) g(\tau^\prime) d \tau^\prime. $$

				Now, we can swap \( f \) and \( g \) and replace \( \tau^\prime \) by \( \tau \), since this is just a
				arbitrary variable name, and we will finally end up with:

				$$ f(t) \otimes g(t) = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} g(\tau) f(t - \tau) d \tau $$

				used for filter
				hence f = signal, g = filter or kernel
				look up discrete conv
